Like k2000-lm399-log, but with the Keithley 2000-20 in connected in parallel to
the output leads of the scanner, to check if the steps observed are due to the
Keithley 2000 or due to the scanner / breadboard setup.

In addition, I increased the settling time after switching the relay to 180s
(to achieve thermal equilibrium), so the references are sampled approximately
every 33 minutes.

Note: due to a programming error, the readings labeled -20 are also from the original Keithley 2000 up to 2018-02-04 2:30. After this, this mistake was fixed.

Switched Lambda LR613DM to negative rail, and HP 6114A to positive rail. Which means the references were powered off for a few minutes.

Power cut. Power supplies off for a couple of minutes
