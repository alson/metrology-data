Set up automated measurements. Reconnected some wires on breadboard, was not powered off for significant amount of time (if at all).

2018-01-21 around 12.00-13.00: Move MV106 and Keithley 2000-20 around, clean up around it, move cables, put them directly on ground.

2018-01-21 12.40-13.19: VI-700 R... (130 Ohm resistor to be replaced) disconnected, reference unpowered. VI-700 moved, wires moved, and powered up again at 13.19.

2018-01-21 18.50-18.52: Move 3458A forward and back to its position.

2019-10-08: Connected GL95206 10M to 3458A via GR874-to-BNC converters, than on one side a BNC gender changer, two BNC cables, BNC to banana adapters, connected with the non-GND pin to the DMM's two wire resistance terminals. A banana jumper lead from one of the ground pins of the BNC-to-banana plug adapters to guard, with guard floating in the DMM.

2020-04-11 02:00: Keithley 2000x2, Prema 6031A, HP/KS 3458Ax2, Lambda LR-612DM and HP 6114A 15V power supplies turned on
2020-04-12 22:45: Connected 3458Ax2 to F732A with Cat5 wires, F732A to MV106 using banana cable, K199-1 to F732A hi (negative input), MV106 hi (positive input), K199-2 to F732A thermistor input via banana jumper cables.
2020-04-13 8:35: Discovered that K199-1 was showing overload. Cable between MV106 and K199-1 (positive terminal) had become detached from MV106. Plugged back in.
2020-04-26 18:20: Cable from MV106 to K199, and F732A to MV106 got disconnected from MV106 for a couple of minutes. Plugged back in.
2020-04-28 01:48: Lo binding post on 732A was not fastened. I briefly unscrewed both binding posts to remove one of the two Cat5 cables from under the binding posts.
2020-05-03 20:46: Cable from 732A binding post to K199 was detached from 732A. Probably for a couple of hours. Plugged back in.
2020-10-19T19:00:29: Cable from 732A lo binding post to D4910 lo binding post got detached until 2020-12-21.
2020-12-21: Discovered that high input cable from d4910_avg_1 to k2000 was loose, and likely the reason for the intermittent and extremely high readings. Probably this was the case since pretty much the beginning of the measurement of the d4910.

2022-04-19 01:..: In ks3458a1-dcv-log.csv, used D4920avg instead of D4910avg -> fixed
GR1440 100k s/n 2312: Plugged into sense terminals, with Fluke 50cm twin-banana lead from top to force jacks (738716)

Fluke 742A: Shield connected to ground terminal. Guard open on 3458A side.
GR1440 1M #5: Plugged into sense jacks, Fluke 50cm twin-banana lead from female terminals to force jacks (738716)

Until 2022-05-01: ks3458a1-dcv-log was logging Datron 4910 avg output

2022-08-11: Resistor comparison at high ambient temperature (~30 degrees outside)
8:00 UTC: Turn on ks3458a2
10:39-10:41 UTC: Move UT330C to where most resistors are.
~10:45 UTC: Start measuring SR104 with ks3458a
13:25-13:27 UTC: Open lid SR104
I removed the double banana plug from GR1440 10k #2 so I can use the Kelvin leads, as usual, because plugging banana leads in the back didn't make good contact.

Measured GR1440 resistors same as 2022-04-19, except GR1440 10k #2 same as #3 and others.
Noted that GR1440 1M (measured in 2w, sense disconnected) appeared to be drifting downward while plugged into 3458A.
K5155 and GL95206 using shorter 30-40cm BNC cables (RG-58) and guard switch open and nothing connected to it.

12:18 Move PT100 from next to UT330C on top of PLZ 300W to L&N 10k resistor
12:53 k2000 aan
14:28:00 Switched 3458A-2 from 100k to 10k range by hand

~16:25 during measurement of SR1 the temperature probe was in LN 1400704

L&N resistors that had nuts:
10k SN 1502633
100 SN 1501564
1k SN 1550730

21:54-21:56
Until 21:54 the PT100 probe stayed into the P4017, despite already measuring the Guildine 95206. Before 21:56 I moved the PT100 probe to touch the shell of the GR874 connectors wedged inbetween the two connectors.

23:14 moved PT100 probe back to under the handle of the PLZ 300W next to the UT330C

2022-08-15 16:50:30 - 16:51:00: Moved UT330C from next to PT100 probe on PLZ300W to next to acqusition BBB machine on top of extension cord / surge suppressor.

2022-08-18
7.40 UTC 2x3458A on
2022-08-18 7.49-7.51 UTC moved pt100 from PLZ 300W to touching the bbb next to UT330C
8:00 Moved 5450A and turned on
8.15 Moved all resistors on top of 5450A

19:30 UTC: Turn on Fluke 510A

2022-08-18: Read up on gaurding, and drew the following conclusions:
1. Never leave guard floating. If at all possible, connect on LO side of DUT. Otherwise set switch to connect it to LO
2. For resistors, connect to negative sense terminal unless they have a separate guard terminal (SR104). For high resistors connect shield to guard
3. For voltage references, connect to voltage refence guard terminal if possible, or otherwise to where the LO lead is connected.
4. For 5450A, connect to guard terminal and do not press the external guard switch.

23:20 - 23:21: Moved PT100 probe from next to BBB to on top of F5450A in the middle

2022-08-19
Around 1-2am: Pt100 probe fell on the floor off 5450A 


07:41 3458a1 acal dcv: cal value out of range 102
07.50 3458a1 acal dcv: 205 hardware failure -- cal value out of range: 101
Repeated attempt works

I found an issue in all the resistance scripts except sr104 transfer that I
only ran acal Ohms, and not acal dc, after 24h/1 degrees temp change. And this
function did not set last acal date, so might have been doing acal every 15
minutes

09:43 Pt100 probe back on top of 5450A

205,"HARDWARE FAILURE -- CAL VALUE OUT OF RANGE: 102"; 210,"HARDWARE FAILURE -- CALIBRATION REQUIRED"; 101,"CALIBRATION ERROR"

19:48: Changed ag3458a1 acv script to not run acal at all

21:32-21:34: Pt100 fell, put back
21:34: Briefly disconnected and reconnected Fluke 510A from mains power.

22:09: Moved pt100 probe from top of 5450A to between 95206 GR connectors.

Measured 95206 as follows:
Same short BNC cables to BNC-to-banana plugs. Center plugs in input binding
posts on 3458A. Fluke 7002 cables from both shields to guard terminal. Guard
switch open.

2022-08-20:
00:22: Moved Pt100 back to 5450A
00:27: Moved UT330C from next to BBB to near Pt100 on top of 5450A

07:50: 3458a2 also gave error during acal DCV with Fluke 510A connected to input:
205,"HARDWARE FAILURE -- CAL VALUE OUT OF RANGE: 102"; 210,"HARDWARE FAILURE -- CALIBRATION REQUIRED"; 101,"CALIBRATION ERROR"

And 3458a1 acal DCV and AC worked fine when the lead was disconnected from the positive input.

15:23:53 connected F510A back to ag3458A (temporarily disconnected for ACAL)

2022-08-22

12:26 Moved PT100 from inside AOIP resistor to under GR1440-7 and next to GR1440-6
GR1400-6/GR1400-7: Had BNC to banana adapters in 3458A input connectors with 7002 cable to sense, and had shield connected to sense.
12:52: Moved adapters so center of Kelvin leads was now sense, and banana leads went to input. Kept GR1440-7 connected.
13:53: Dropped pt100 and put back. Still on F742A-1 under GR1440-7
14:31-14:33: Dropped pt100 and put back
20:52: Entered 1.01 Ohm as value for F742A instead of 1 Ohm

2022-08-23
LN 1547580 instead of L&N
LN 1550730

2022-08-24
00:06-00:08 Removed tissue under PT100 and removed one layer under UT330C so the pt100 is directly touching HP 11103A
02:47 pt100 fell again and put back against HP 11103
16:40 Put PT100 in SR104 thermometer well
16:40: SR104 measured as dut=HP 11103A, setting=10 kOhm-SR104, but I disconnected and re-connected it again, so probably no data was saved under that name.
20:08: Moved Pt100 between GR1440-2 and -3
22:40: Moved Pt100 to SR104

2022-08-25
00:43 Move pt100 from SR104 to GL95260
01:18: Measured P4017 with 9520 with BNC cables to BNA-to-banana plug adapter in A/B posts, and short banana leads (not low EMF) from the shield to the E terminal.

Until 1:58: Measured GL9330-100k with old nuts and steel washers
After 1:59: Measured GL9330-100k with original nuts borrowed from GL9330-1M
GR1440-2312: Couldn't find a way of attaching pt100 probe, so stayed on 5450A
GR1440-5: same, though dropped probe briefly
~3:30 cleaned GL9330-100k, GL9330-1M, F742A-1M and F742A-10 with contaclean
04:19 Noticed that one of the two spade lugs from F510A got detached from the w4920. Reattached.
For all resistance measurements I used the ~2m low thermal EMF 4-wire cable with guard connected to either the resistor's shield or the negative (sense) terminal. For the 2W measurements I used blue and white in the 4w cable, and connected orange and green to guard together with shield. Fpr the 95206 I used ~.5m BNC RG58 leads

04:56: Moved pt100 from P4017 to Guildline 95206
10:02: 100075.316 reading for 4w resistance was when switching to SR104
10:47 Move ptoo to between F7001 and F510A on top of F732A2
11:26: For D4910-[34] I made a short banana lead with alligator clip (not low EMF) from guard terminal to cable shield lug.
F7001bat ks3458a1-dcv-log before 13:03:20: was logging -10V with positive and guard lead connected to negative terminal
After 13:03:20: Moved guard to positive terminal together with negative lead from 3458A.
F7001 ks3458a1-dcv-log before 14:40:38 was logging -10V with positive and guard lead connected to negative terminal
17:51: GL9330-100k fell about 1m on the ground. Pt100 also fell. moved it under F7001
18:18 moved Pt100 to GL9330-100k
19:13 Started k2000-sr104-thermistor-log

4950 gives error hf intermittently. If it occurs, it will persist, but restarting the script, which resets it to DCV, and setting it back to ACV fixes it
10 mV 1 kHz gives error hf. Lowering frequency to 900 Hz allows 4950 to read without error (frequency checked by F189

100 uA 1 kHz always give error HF. For lower frequencies 100 uA gives errors intermittently. Higher currents don't give error.
The overload LED on the V2500 also flashes after every sample, at least on 1 mA, so that seems to be the 2500, not the D4700.

2023-02-06 to 2023-02-10:
Measure AD588 and LM399 references using K2000 with its scanner, and regulary compare to F732a3. Pt100 (k2000-20-4w-res-log.py) was on breadboard between LM399s and AD588s measured by k2000-20.

2023-02-10:
Measure Datron 4700 100 Ohms using K2000 and K2000-20 as reference for PT100 (k2000(-20)-4w-res-log.csv).
Measure two Pt100s in direct contact taped with masking tape and wrapped in a beach towel.

2023-03-02:
D4700-10V measured by tying D4700 lo to F7001bat high, and measuring with k182 between D4700 hi and F7001bat lo

2023-06-24:
Compared voltage references. D4910-2 binding posts broke off, so measured
D4910avg - D4910-2 by pressing the spade lug against the binding post from the
top from the heat shrink. Check this data for drift / noise.
